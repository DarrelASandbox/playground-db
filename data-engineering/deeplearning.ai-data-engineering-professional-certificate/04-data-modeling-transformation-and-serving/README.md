# Data Engineering: Modeling, Transformation & Serving

## Course Overview

- Fourth and final course in the data engineering specialization.
- Focuses on **data modeling**, **transformation**, and **serving data** for end use cases.
- Builds on previous courses covering **ingestion**, **storage**, **data ops**, and **orchestration**.

## Course Focus

- **Core objective**: Turn raw data into useful insights and deliver business value.
- Emphasizes creating accurate representations of real-world complexity in databases.
- Addresses challenges in integrating diverse data sources (e.g., websites, mobile apps, surveys, acquired businesses).

### Key Stakeholder Value

- Ensures data systems enable efficient querying and reflect real-world accuracy.
- Prepares learners to handle evolving data landscapes and merging datasets.

## Data Modeling Challenges

- **Real-world complexity**: Capturing diverse data streams (e.g., clickstream, purchases, API calls, surveys).
- **Integration**: Merging overlapping user databases from acquisitions with conflicting attributes.
- **Impact of design**: Data representation affects question-answering efficiency and accuracy.

## Machine Learning Serving Complexities

- **Deployment challenges**: Software architecture, storage, and scaling for ML model serving.
- **Concept drift**: Addressing discrepancies between training data and evolving real-world data.
  - Requires systems to **detect changes** and trigger model updates.
  - Combines **statistical analysis** with engineering solutions.

## Data Engineering Lifecycle

- **Continuous cycle**: Revisiting earlier lifecycle stages (e.g., ingestion, storage) during deployment.
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Balancing software engineering with statistical monitoring for sustainable solutions.
- **Complexity as core**: Emphasizes iterative processes and integration across the entire data pipeline.
